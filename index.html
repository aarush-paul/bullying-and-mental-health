				<h1>What is Bullying?</h1>
				<p>Bullying is the use of force, coercion, hurtful teasing or threat, to abuse, aggressively dominate or intimidate. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception (by the bully or by others) of an imbalance of physical or social power. This imbalance distinguishes bullying from conflict. Bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three criteria:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>hostile intent</li>
					<li>imbalance of power</li>
					<li>repetition over a period of time.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Bullying is the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally, or emotionally.</p>

				<h1>What are the causes of Bullying?</h1>
				<p>There are many reasons that lead to bullying in schools. One of the main causes is the cultural factor. This includes race and ethnicity. A child may be a bully or a victim if he or she comes from a majority race or the minority race respectively. Another cause of bullying in schools is the nature of life a child is exposed to. In many families in the developed countries, children are comfortably allowed to watch TV even in their bedrooms. Instead of studying, such children spend their time playing computer games. The games they play make them bullies because they see others practice the same. High expectations of parents on their children contribute to bullying. This is the case because a child will spend a lot of time studying so as to perform well and meet the parents’ expectations. Failure to achieve the target may develop stress in a child and they will express anger through shouting or bullying fellow learners. Another cause of bullying in schools emanates from the social status of the family. A child from a humble background will always have some pressurizing needs that are not met. This child will always want to express this frustration to the fellow learners, especially those coming from stable families by bullying them.</p>

				<h1>What are the effects of Bullying?</h1>
				<p>Kids who bully use their power to control or harm others and can be done in different ways. There are various types of bullying that can be experienced, and some can be more obvious than others. The types of bullying are: physical, verbal, isolation or exclusion, social, cyber, sexual, and racial bullying. Physical bullying is related to dominance and involves hurting a person’s body or possessions. It can include hitting, tripping, kicking, pinching, pushing, or damaging property. Verbal bullying is saying or writing harmful things. It can involve name calling, insults, teasing, and intimidation. Words have a lot of power and can be very detrimental to a person’s self-image or self-esteem. Physical and verbal bullying tends to be more overt, while the others can be nearly invisible. Isolation or exclusion bullying can be subtle and often takes place without adult awareness. It involves ignoring someone, openly excluding or isolating that individual, or giving someone the silent treatment. It is ultimately, a type of social rejection. Social bullying involves harming someone’s reputation or causing humiliation. This includes lying, spreading rumors, encouraging exclusion, or damaging social reputation or acceptance. Cyber bullying involves technologies such as computers or smartphones where students can instant message, email, post, or share images. It involves hurtful or abusive messages, gossiping online, or posting nasty things about an individual. Some common places cyberbullying occurs are social media, short message services, and instant messenger. According to a website called stopbulling.gov, “The content an individual shares online-both their personal content as well as any negative, mean, or hurtful content-creates a kind of permanent public record of their views, activities, and behavior.” Cyberbullying can be very destructive because it can be anonymous, go viral, and leave the victim with no safe place to escape. This makes cyber bullying unique because it is persistent, permanent, and can be hard to notice. Sexual bullying involves unwelcome or unwanted sexual comments, attention, or physical contact. Racial bullying is a type of racism where the bullying is focused on race, ethnicity, or culture. It can include being called racist names, racist jokes, and being insulted. The causes for bullying are varied; any student can become a target, regardless of race, gender, religion, or socioeconomic status.</p>

				<h1>How can we prevent bullying?</h1>
				<p>People must step in to stop bullying straight away. Often, the people doing the deeds don’t realize what they’re doing is hurtful. Joking around and “banter” can often be construed as harmless fun. But authority figures must warn the bully about their behavior. It’s equally important to let peers know how to spot bullying. Schools and workplaces can target the problem by organizing an anti-bullying day. This day should involve speeches and exercises that both highlight the issue and bring people closer together. In practice, this eliminates the need for an authority figure to step in.

					Not all bullying occurs because of deep-rooted issues within the bully. Other people might feel as if they have been wronged in some way. Instead of raising their concerns, they resort to overt and covert methods of bullying. To combat this, a meeting of the minds is the best way to stop this scenario from going any further. Have a quiet talk with the individual and ask them why they’re acting the way they are. It’s likely that they have a problem which, in their minds, was caused by the person they’re bullying. After this, bring both parties together and attempt to speak about the issue openly. Bullying nearly always gets worse because it’s often swept under the rug and ignored.</p>
